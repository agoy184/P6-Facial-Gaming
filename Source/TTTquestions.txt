1. How well did your interface work?
The interface worked well in that it could take pictures of me using my webcam. 
It could also read my facial expressions to an extent.

2. Did it recognize your facial expressions with the same accuracy as it achieved against the test set?
No, it did not read with the same amount of accuracy as the test set. Most of the the attempted faces I made were read as neutral.

3. If not, why not?
My facial expressions were not read with the same accuracy due to my facial expressions being less expressive than the samples photos.
This may be due to the fact that my facial features are smaller than the the features of the people used in the sample photos.
I am of Chinese/Japanese descent, so it is understandable that my facial features are a bit smaller and harder to read.
Most of the people in the kaggle sample photos had large eyes and mouths, so it must have been easier to recognize their facial expressions.
